# About me

Recently graduated in Multiplatform Application Development with a strong interest in `Full Stack development`. Passionate about creating web and mobile applications that enhance people's lives. Currently, I am specializing in ``React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end``. Eager to bring my ``technical skills`` to innovative projects, I also prioritize modern soft skills vital for a programmer in 2024. These include adaptability in fast-paced environments, ``effective remote collaboration``, ``continuous learning mindset``, ``critical thinking for problem-solving``, and ``strong communication skills`` to bridge gaps between technical and non-technical teams. Looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to innovative projects with both my ``technical abilities and soft skills``. ðŸš€
